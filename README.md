# jrmp-4-to-9
This is a porting process for Joyride Modpack to BombSquad version 9.

# We are currently working on getting Joyride Modpack to API 9. 
Here's what this'll bring:
Modern netcode, so less laggy gameplay.
More modding potential, with more features and more choices.
It'll bring it to a more modern audience.
